# PCAT (Probabilistic Cataloger)

PCAT is a Bayesian framework to sample from the catalog space. It's theoretical framework is introduced in [Daylan, Portillo & Finkbeiner (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04637), submitted to ApJ. Refer to its [webpage](http://www.tansudaylan.com/pcat) for an introduction.


### Installation

You can install PCAT either by using ```pip```
```
pip install pcat
```

or, by running its `setup.py` script.

```
python setup.py install
```

Note that PCAT depends on [TDPY](https://github.com/tdaylan/tdpy), a library of MCMC and numerical routines. The pip installation will install PCAT along with its dependencies.
