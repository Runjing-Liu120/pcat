Welcome to PCAT's documentation!
================================

When testing hypotheses or inferring their free parameters, a recurring problem is to compare models that contain a number of elements whose multiplicity is itself unknown. Therefore, given some data, it is desirable to be able to compare models with different numbers of elem parameters. One way of achieving this is to obtain a point estimate (usually the most likely point) in the parameter space of each model and, then, rely on some information criterion to penalize more complex models for excess degrees of freedom. Another way is to sample from the parameter space of each model and compare their Bayesian evidences. Yet another is to take samples from the union of these models using a set of transdimensional jumps across models. This is what the Probabilistic Cataloger (PCAT) is designed for.

PCAT is a hierarchical, transdimensional, Bayesian inference framework. It's theoretical framework is introduced in `Daylan, Portillo & Finkbeiner (2016) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04637>`_, accepted to ApJ. In astrophysical applications, given the output of a photon counting experiment, it can be used to sample from **the catalog space**. In a more general context, it can be used as a mixture sampler to infer the posterior distribution of a metamodel given some Poisson distributed data.

In what follows, we assume that **the metamodel** is the union of models with different dimensionality. All such models have a certain number of common, **fixed-dimensional** parameters. In addition, each model has a different number of **elements**. An element is a collection of parameters that only exist together, and characterize an entity in the model. Examples are:

- A light source such as a pulsar, Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in an astrophysical emission model,
- A dark matter subhalo that deflects background light,
- A term in the polynomial used to perform linear regression

Features
----------
Compared to mainstream Bayesian inference methods, PCAT has a series of desirable features. It

- samples from the space of catalogs given some observation, unlike conventional cataloging, which estimates the most likely catalog,
- allows marginalization over all relevant nuisance parameters in the problem, including the dimensionality of the nuisance,
- reveals potentially non-Gaussian within and across model covariances,
- constrains element population characteristics via hierarchical priors,
- is a Bayesian framework, because point estimates fail in nearly degenerate likelihood topologies,
- implements Occam's razor (model parsimony) through natural priors on the number of degrees of freedom,
- strictly respects detailed across models, 
- does not discard information contained in low-significance :math:`(< 5 \sigma)` fluctuations in the observed dataset,
- reduces to a deterministic cataloger when the labeling degeneracy is explicitly broken,
- simultaneously infers the Point Spread Function (PSF) and the level of diffuse background.

Transdimensionality
+++++++++++++++++++

PCAT takes steps across models by proposing to add elements whose parameters are drawn from the prior, or to kill randomly chosen elements, while respecting detailed balance in the metamodel.


Hierarchical priors
+++++++++++++++++++++

When there are multiple model elements, each with a set of parameters, it is natural to put priors on the **distribution** of these parameters, as opposed to placing individual priors separately on each element parameter. This assumes that a certain type of parameter of all elements, are drawn from a single probability distribution. This is particularly useful when such a parameter is subject to inference, and individual elements can be marginalized over. This results in a hierarchical prior structure, where the prior is placed on the distribution of element parameters, i.e., **hyperparameters**, and the prior on the individual element parameters are made conditional on these hyperparameters. 


Labeling degeneracy
++++++++++++++++++++++

Due to **hairlessness** of the elements, the likelihood function is invariant to their permutations in the parameter vector, i.e., exchanging the labels of two elements leaves the likelihood invariant. This fact has consequences for **nonpersistent** elements, which get born or killed at least once during an MCMC run. Because of label changes, the posterior of these parameters look the same, which makes them useless for inferring their properties. In order to constrain such elements, the degeneracy must be broken in post-processing of the samples. Note that, if the sampling is continued sufficiently long, e.g., for a Hubble time, the posterior of all transdimensional parameters will eventually look similar.

.. Breaking the labeling degeneracy
.. +++++++++++++++++++

Proposal optimization
+++++++++++++++++

Construction of an MCMC chain requires a choice of proposal scale, which must remain constant (or strictly decrease) during sampling in order to respect detailed balance. In transdimensional inference, the choice of proposal scale includes both within and across model jumps. PCAT chooses the proposal scale for a particular sampling problem based on an initial calculation of the Fisher information at the maximum likelihood solution, in the beginning of each run, yielding an estimate of the model covariance. The tighter a parameter is constrained, the smaller the proposal scale for that parameter becomes. This ensures that the acceptance ratio is around 25% and minimizes the autocorrelation time of the resulting chain.

PCAT takes heavy-tailed within-model steps in a space, where the prior is uniformly distributed. The transdimensional proposals are 

In order to ensure that the chains start from a well mixed state, the first ``numbburn`` samples are discarded and the resulting chain is thinned by  a factor of ``factthin``.


Performance
+++++++++++++++++++

The above features are made possible by enlarging the hypothesis space so as to minimize mismodeling of the observed data. This is, however, at the expense of seriously slowing down inference.

PCAT alleviates the performance issues in two ways:

- Use of parallelism via bypassing Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) by employing independent processes as opposed to threads. The parent process spawns multiple, (almost) noninteracting processes, which collect samples in parallel and report back to the parent process, which aggregates and post-processes the samples.

- Locality approximation in the likelihood evaluation. The most time consuming part of the inference is the model evaluation, which can be prohibitevly slow (for large datasets and many elements) if no approximations are made. PCAT assumes that the contribution of the elements to the model vanishes outside some circle around the element.


Input
--------------
PCAT expects input data in the folder ``pathbase/data/inpt/``. The typical inputs are the data and exposure data cubes, background template(s) (if applicable), element kernel template(s) and the PSF (if applicable).

Supplying data
+++++++++++++++
Input dataset is provided through the ``strgexprflux`` argument. This should be the name of a FITS file (including the ``.fits`` extension), which contains a numpy array of dimension :math:`N_e \times N_{pix} \times N_{psf}`, where :math:`N_e` is the number of energy bins, :math:`N_{pix}` is the number of spatial pixels and :math:`N_{psf}` is the number of PSF classes. The units should be photons per cm :math:`^2` per seconds per GeV.

The exposure map is suppled via the ``strgexpo`` argument. This should be the name of a FITS file (including the ``.fits`` extension). The format should be the same as ``strgexprflux``, whereas units should be cm :math:`^2` s.

Similary, background templates can be provided via the ``back`` argument. ``back`` should be a list of FITS file names (including the ``.fits`` extension), whose format should be same as that of ``strgexprflux``.

Specifying the model and placing priors
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The prior structure of the model is set by the relevant arguments to ``pcat.main.init()``. PCAT allows the following fixed dimensional parameters in each member of the metamodel:

- Background prediction

    Given an observed count map, the number of counts in each pixel can be modeled as a Poisson realization of the total counts from a number of elements. In practice, however, this number can be prohibitively large, when there are many more **faint** elements compared to bright ones. Therefore, it is computationally more favorable to represent the overall contribution of faint elements (those that negligibly affect the likelihood) with **background** templates. PCAT allows a list of spatially and spectrally distinct background templates to be in the model simultaneously. 

- PSF
    
    PSF defines a how a delta function in the position space projects onto the observed count maps. When the elements are count sources, PCAT assumes that the projection of all elements to the count maps are characterized by the same PSF. PSF convolution of the model prediction is only applicable for applications, where the observed count map has been collected with an instrument with a finite PSF.


Distributions of element features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All features of elements are assumed to have been drawn from an underlying probability distribution, and cross-correlations between element features are assumed to be zero. The 1-point function of the element features are controlled by the function arguments to ``pcat.main.init()``. Furthermore, elements are divided into **populations**, where each population admits its own set of hyperparameters. Therefore the input to these arguments should be a ``list`` of strings.

- Spatial distribution (``spatdisttype``)

+ ``'unif'``
Both horizontal positions, :math:`\theta_1`, and vertical positions, :math:`\theta_2`, are uniformly distributed between :math:`-\theta_{max}` and :math:`\theta_{max}`, where :math:`2\theta_{max}` is the side of the square in which model elements can exist.

.. math::
    
    P(\theta_1) &= \frac{1}{2\theta_{max}} \\
    P(\theta_2) &= \frac{1}{2\theta_{max}}


+ ``'disc'``
Horizontal positions, :math:`\theta_1`, are assumed to be uniformly distributed, whereas the vertical positions, :math:`\theta_2`, are drawn from the exponential distribution.

.. math::
    
    P(\theta_1) &= \frac{1}{2\theta_{max}} \\
    P(\theta_2) &= \frac{1}{\theta_{2s}} \exp \Bigg( -\frac{\theta_2}{\theta_{2s}}\Bigg)

The scale of the exponential distribution, :math:`\theta_{2s}`, is a hyperparameter subject to inference and set by ``bgaldistscal``.


+ ``'gang'``
Radial positions, :math:`\theta_r`, are assumed to follow an exponential distribution with an angular scale, :math:`\theta_{rs}`, controlled by ``gangdistscal``. The azimuthal positions, :math:`\phi`, are uniformly distributed.

.. math::
    
    P(\phi) &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \\
    P(\theta_r) &= \frac{1}{\theta_{rs}} \exp \Bigg( -\frac{\theta_r}{\theta_{rs}}\Bigg)


+ ``'gaus'``
The prior spatial distributon is the sum of a certain number of Gaussians and a spatially constant floor.

.. math::
    
    P(\theta_1, \theta_2) \propto \alpha_c + c \sum_k \exp \Bigg(-\frac{1}{2}\frac{(\theta_1 - \theta_k)^2}{\sigma_c^2}\Bigg) \exp \Bigg(-\frac{1}{2}\frac{(\theta_2 - \theta_k)^2}{\sigma_c^2}\Bigg)

:math:`c` is a normalizing constant that brings the maximum of the second term to unity. The amplitude of the floor, :math:`\alpha_c`, is set by the hyperparameter ``spatdistcons``. It roughly parametrizes the degree of belief in the provided catalog. This spatial model is useful is there is a strong prior belief that elements exist at certain locations. An example is searching for elements at the positions of a earlier (deterministic) catalog. 


- Flux distribution (``fluxdisttype``)

+ ``'powr'``
Power law between ``minmflux`` and ``maxmflux`` with the slope ``fluxdistslop``.

+ ``'bind'``
Power law
Piecewise power law between ``minmflux`` and ``maxmflux`` with the slopes ``fluxdistslopbinX``, where X is the piece index.

- Spectral index distribution

Spectral index distribution of elements can be set with the argument ``sinddisttype``.

+ ``'atan'``
Spectral indices :math:`s_a` are distributed such that :math:`\arctan(s_a)` follow the uniform distribution between :math:`\arctan(s_{min})` and :math:`\arctan(s_{max})`. :math:`s_{min}` and :math:`s_{max}` can be set by ``minmsind`` and ``maxmflux``, respectively.

+ ``'gaus'``
Spectral indices :math:`s_a` follow a Gaussian distribution with mean :math:`\lambda_s` and variance :math:`\sigma_s^2`.


Generating mock data
+++++++++++++++++++++
PCAT ships with a mock (simulated) data generator. Mock data is randomly drawn from a generative metamodel, not to be confused with the metamodel subject to inference, (hereafter, **the fitting metamodel**). Once the user configures the prior probability density of the fitting metamodel, PCAT samples from this metamodel given the simulated dataset. Some of the generative metamodel parameters can be fixed, i.e., assigned delta function priors. These are

- the number of mock elements, ``truenumbpnts``,
- hyperparameters controlling the population characteristics of these elements.

All other generative metamodel parameters are fair draws from the hierarchical prior. 

When working on variations of a certain problem or different analyses on the same dataset, it is useful to have default priors. PCAT allows unique defaults for different built-in experiments, controlled by the argument ``exprtype``. Currently the built-in experimental types are 

- ``ferm``: Fermi-LAT (Default)
- ``chan``: Chandra
- ``hubb``: Hubble Space Telescope
- ``sdss``: SDSS
- ``gaia``: Gaia

By setting ``exprtype`` the user imposes the default prior structure for the chosen experimental type. However, it is also desirable to be able to change the prior of a specific parameter. This is accomplished by setting the :ref:`relevant argument(s) <sectoutp>`.

.. note::

    PCAT has a built-in fudicial (default) generative metamodel for each experiment type. The user can change parts of this model by providing arguments with the parameter names with a preceeding string ``'true'`` (indicating the fudicial model). The model subject to inference defaults to the resulting fudicial model. The user can also change parts of the fitting metamodel by setting arguments with the relevant parameter names (this time, without ``'true'``, indicating the fitting metamodel). In other words, if the user does not specify any parameters, the fudicial model will be used to generate data, and the same model will be fitted to the data. In most cases, however, one is be interested in studying mismodeling, i.e., when the mock data is generated from a model different from that used to fit the data. This can be achieved by forcing the prior structure of the fitting metamodel to be different from the generator model.


Selecting the initial state
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The initial state of the chain is drawn randomly from the prior.


.. _sectoutp:

Output
-------------
A function call to ``pcat.main.init()`` returns the collected samples as well as postprocessed variables in an object that we will refer to as ``gdat``. Any output (as well as many internal variables of the sampler) can be accessed via the attributes of this global object. 

Furthermore, PCAT offers extensive routines to visualize the output chain. The output plots are placed in the relevant subfolders ``pathbase/data/outp/rtag`` and ``pathbase/imag/rtag``, respectively, where ``rtag`` is the run tag. The ``pathbase`` folder is created if it does not already exist. It defaults to the value of the environment variable ``$PCAT_DATA_PATH``. Therefore ``pathbase`` can be omitted by setting the environment variable ``$PCAT_DATA_PATH``.


.. _sectplot:

Plots
+++++
If not expilicity disabled by the user, PCAT produces plots in every stage of a run. Some plots are produced in the initial setup, frame plots are generated at predetermined times during the sampling and others are made in the postprocessing after all chains have run. The plot path, ``pathbase/imag/rtag``, has the following structure:

- ``init`` Problem setup
- ``fram`` Frame plots, giving snapshots of the MCMC state
- ``diag`` Diagnostic plots
- ``post`` Posterior distribution of model parameters and derived quantities
- ``anim`` GIF animations made from the frame plots in ``fram`` that are produced during sampling.
- ``opti`` Proposal scale optimization
- ``info`` Information gain


.. _sectchan:

Chain
+++++
``pcat.main.init()`` returns a pointer to the object that contains the output chain. It also writes the output chain to ``$PCAT_DATA_PATH/outp/rtag/pcat.h5``, which is an HDF5 file. Each dataset (or object attribute as in the former case) is an ``ndarray`` of samples, either of the parameters or of quantities derived from the parameters, as well as diagnostic and utility variables.

In overall, the output folder contains the following files:

- ``args.txt``

The list of arguments to ``pcat.main.init()``.

- ``pcat.h5``

HDF5 file containing samples from the hypothesis space, with the following fields:

=================  ==========================================================================
Field              Explanation
=================  ==========================================================================
``sampvarb``       Parameter vector
``samp``           Scaled parameter vector (uniformly distributed with respect to the prior)
``deltllikpopl``   Delta loglikelihood of the l:math:`^{th}` population
``lgalpopl``       Horizontal coordinates of the l:math:`^{th}` population
``bgalpopl``       Vertical coordinates of the l:math:`^{th}` population

``fluxpopl``       Flux of the l:math:`^{th}` population
``sindpopl``       Spectral index of the l:math:`^{th}` population
``curvpopl``       Spectral curvature of the l:math:`^{th}` population
``expopopl``       Spectral cutoff energy of the l:math:`^{th}` population

In order to reduce inter-process communication, PCAT writes its internal state to the disc before child processes are spawned and after individual workers have finished their tasks. These intermediate files, in the form of python pickle objects, are temporarily written to the output folder, but deleted before the run ends.


Diagnostics
------------

Autocorrelation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A chain of states needs to be Markovian (memoryless) in order to be interpreted as fair draws from a target probability density. The autocorrelation of the chain shows whether the chain is self-similar along the simulation time (either due to low acceptance rate or small step size). Therefore the autocorrelation plots should be monitored after eah run.

In a transdimensional setting, the autocorrelation of a parameter is ill-defined, since parameters can be born, killed or change identity. Therefore, for such parameters, we calculate the autocorrelation of the model count map.

The acceptance rate of the birth and death moves shows whether the prior on the element parameters are appropriate. If the acceptance rate of birth and deaths proposals is too low, this indicates that an element randomly drawn from the prior is very unlikely to fit the data. In contrast, if it is too high, it means that most of the prior volume is insensitive to the data. Therefore the prior should be adjusted such that the birth and death acceptance rate is between :math:`\sim 5%% - \sim30%%`. This allows efficient jumps and minimizes autocorrelation across models. 

Gelman-Rubin test
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
PCAT nominally runs multiple, noninteracting chains, whose samples are aggregated at the end. In order to ensure convergence, therefore, one can compare within-chain variance with across-chain variance. This is known as the Gelman-Rubin test. PCAT outputs the GR test statistics in ``gdat.gmrb`` and plots the relevant diagnostics in ``$PCAT_DATA_PATH/imag/rtag/diag/``.

.. note:: Make sure to run PCAT with the argument ``diagmode=False`` for reasonable time performance. ``diagmode=True`` option puts the sampler in a conservative diagnostic mode and performs extensive checks on the state of critical data structures to ensure that the model and proposals are self consistent, largely slowing down execution.


Tutorial
--------------
In this tutorial, we will illustrate how to run PCAT during a typical science analysis. Assuming that you have :ref:`installed <sectinst>` PCAT, let us run it on mock data.

All user interaction with PCAT can be performed through the ``pcat.main.init()`` function. Because arguments to this function have hierarchically defined defaults, even the default call (without arguments) starts a valid PCAT run. The default call generates mock Fermi-LAT data with an isotropic background and point source distribution and takes samples from the catalog space of the generated data. Therefore it assumes that you have the necessary IRF file as well as exposure, data and background flux files in ``pathbase/data/inpt/``.

.. In case you don't, here is a script that should get you the necessary files.

The default run collects a single chain of 100000 samples, discards the initial 20% of the samples and thins the remaining samples to obtain a chain of 1000 samples. The number of processes, total number of samples per process, the number of samples to be discarded and the factor by which to thin the chain can be set using the arguments ``numbproc``, ``numbswep``, ``numbburn`` and ``factthin``, respectively. After initialization, PCAT collects samples, produces frame plots (snapshots of the sampler state during the execution) and postprocesses the samples at the end. The run should finish in under half an hour with the message

.. code-block:: none
    
    >> The ensemble of catalogs is at $PCAT_DATA_PATH/data/outp/rtag/

While the sampler is running, you can check ``$PCAT_DATA_PATH/imag/rtag/`` to inspect :ref:`the output plots <sectplot>`.

Although PCAT visualizes the ensemble of catalogs in various projections to the data and model spaces, the user can also work directly on :ref:`the output chain <sectchan>`.

.. note::
    
    The generative metamodel parameters can be set by preceeding the parameter name with ``true``. For example, in order to set the mock number of elements, you can specify ``truenumbpnts=array([10])``.


Garbage collection
-------------------

PCAT produces two folders for the output of each run, one for plots and the other to contain the chain saved to the disc. Given that many test and intermediate runs may be needed before each science run, the number of folders (and files therein) may increase quickly. In order to avoid this, the script ``gcol.py`` is provided to the user as a convenience. When executed, it erases the output from all runs that

- have not run to completion, i.e., does not have the animations, which are produced at the very end, or
- has collected less than 100000 samples per chain.
